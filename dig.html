            <h2>Know Before You Go: Dig Safe and Protect Your Water Lines</h2>
            <p>
                Before starting any landscaping, fencing, or construction project on your property — even something as simple as planting a tree — it's critical to contact the Golden Gate Irrigation Water Emergencies/Questions line at (208) 407-0004. Many underground irrigation lines run through residential yards, and damaging them can lead to expensive repairs, water waste, and service disruptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Always contact us before you dig.</strong> Our team will help you identify where irrigation lines are located and guide you through proper digging practices to prevent accidents or violations. In many cases, we'll even mark out water lines for free or as part of a maintenance package.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't risk hitting a line — whether you're using a shovel or heavy equipment, one wrong move can cause major damage. Call us first. We’ll help you stay safe, compliant, and worry-free.
            </p>
            <p><em>“It’s easier to check first than to fix later.”</em></p>
            <p>
                Thinking about planting a tree, installing a fence, or digging for any home project? Before you break ground, you must contact Irrigation LLC. Many underground irrigation lines run through residential and commercial properties, and damaging them can lead to water loss, costly repairs, and service outages.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Anyone who damages an irrigation line without prior consultation will be held financially responsible for all repairs.</strong> These systems are vital to maintaining your landscape and wasting water through unreported damage violates local water-use policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contacting Irrigation LLC before you dig is quick, easy, and essential. Our team will identify and mark the location of your irrigation lines, and advise on safe digging procedures to help you avoid any issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you're using a hand shovel or heavy machinery, it's your responsibility to ensure the area is safe to dig. One call to us can save you thousands in avoidable damage.
